# SecretSwap

## Project Description
**SecretSwap** is a smart contract that enables two users to exchange encrypted messages or digital secrets in a trustless and time-locked environment. Each participant submits an encrypted payload, and both can reveal each other's content only after a predefined unlock time.

## Project Vision
To enable new forms of private and creative communication between individuals using blockchain — digital time capsules, secret gift exchanges, or anonymous storytelling — while enforcing fairness and privacy with smart contracts.

## Key Features
- 🔐 **Two-way encrypted message exchange**
- ⏰ **Time-locked access controlled on-chain**
- 👥 **Dual-user participation for fair and mutual exchange**
- 🚫 **Early access prevention for privacy enforcement**

## Future Scope
- NFT-wrapped vaults to allow secondary market trading of encrypted messages
- Support for anonymous matchmaking and public secret pools
- Off-chain decryption key escrow and automated releases using Chainlink
- Front-end DApp for message creation, encryption, and reveal
- Integration with ENS for easier user discovery and targeting
